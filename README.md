## HTML CV Template 😎

- I have made this template to serve me for my CV 😇
  
- It was developed with html, css, js, sass, bootstrap4.
- I mad it to translate to a pdf later. So the vision is not responsive 😛. We do not need it to be responsive 🤓. So I did not want to waste my time here
- The point here is to exploit your web skills to build your CV 🙂
- You can use online tools like [NeuvoResume](https://novoresume.com/). But it will limits your choices. That is why I use them to get inspired or once I want rapidos work 😁
- The best converter I got after some research that convert it exactly like I made it was [sejda.com](https://www.sejda.com/html-to-pdf). It is free and perfect. Just give your link and it will convert exactly as you design it 😃
- You can check the result in the pdf provided in htis samll project 😁.
